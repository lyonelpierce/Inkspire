              Credits are used to generate images on the platform. Two image
              credits are approximately worth one standard 512x512 image
              generated at 30 steps. This means that if you have 20 image
              credits, you can generate 10 images on the platform.

                If you are using the free plan, a limited number of credits will
                be allocated to you each day, and will reset daily at midnight.
                This means that you can generate a limited number of images each
                day, based on the number of credits allocated to you. Free tier
                users are also limited to a lower number of simultaneous
                generations, and 512x512 resolution.

                If you are on a paid plan of the platform, you will have access
                to your full monthly token allowance at any time, and your
                allowance will reset each month. This means that you can use
                your credits at your own pace and have access to the platformâ€™s
                premium features, throughout the month.

                Yes, if you are on a free plan you can use any public saved

                You can always wait for the end of the month for the credits to
                replenish, or upgrade to the next plan if you are running out of
                credits (upgrades coming soon). Contact us if you are looking
                for a custom plan.
